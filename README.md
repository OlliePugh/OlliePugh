### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

#### Tiny bit about me

I am a final year Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Loughborough University.

#### What do I make?

I make things that typically don't have much of a purpose but are pretty fun to play/interact with! Interact is a key word for the projects I make, I love making things that people from all over the world can interact with from the comfort of their own home!

- ðŸš— Want to drive an RC car but don't have one, [You don't need one...](https://github.com/OlliePugh/race-track-orch)

- ðŸŽƒ Wanted to make your own VR Horror Game but don't know how to do any game design? You can make and control the game all from your web browser... [I got you](https://github.com/OlliePugh/halloween-vr)

- ðŸŽ„ Why not even [decorate my Christmas Tree](https://github.com/OlliePugh/online-christmas-tree-ui) for me?

All of these projects get put onto my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ollieq) in a entertainment/comedy (My mum thinks they're funny?) style.

#### But Why?
Growing up I was always under the impression computers/engineering is boring, and now I fully beleive that engineering and programming is as boring as you make it, so make sure you make it fun! So I post these projects/videos in the hope it can change the minds of people to get involved and try it out themselves!

Just because no one has done it yet, doesn't mean you shouldn't.
